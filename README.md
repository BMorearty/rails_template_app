# Rails Template App

1. Run this command from the directory *above* rails_template_app:

    rails_template_app/bin/copy_into_new_app.rb APP_NAME

   The new app will be created in a folder at the same level as
   rails_template_app.

2. Search the newly generated app for AppName, appname, and app_name
   (substitute your app name, of course). Fix up as desired.

3. Search for TODO. Fix up as desired.

# What this template does

* Blah blah,
* and blah blah
